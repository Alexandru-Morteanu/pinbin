## AboutUs âœ¨[![Info](https://img.shields.io/badge/info-green.svg)](README.md)

ðŸŒ´Founded in 2023, PinBin started as a small group of environmental enthusiasts who were deeply concerned about the increasing pollution levels around the world. We realized that while many people were aware of the issue, there was a lack of a platform that could help individuals contribute towards the cause in a meaningful way. That's when PinBin was born.Our mission is to raise awareness about pollution and inspire action through the power of photography. We believe in the power of community and the impact that each individual can make. We aim to bring together people from all walks of life to contribute towards a cleaner and healthier planet.ðŸŒ´

Prerequisites  
Node.js installed on your machine.  
npm (Node Package Manager) installed.  
Installation Steps  
Clone the Repository

bash  
Copy code  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git  
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash  
Copy code  
cd your-project  
Install Dependencies

bash  
Copy code  
npm install  
Configuration

Check if there's a configuration file (e.g., .env or config.js) and update it with your configuration settings, if needed.  
Run the Project Locally

bash  
Copy code  
npm start  
Open in Browser  
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (replace 3000 with the port specified in your project).

Additional Configuration (if needed)  
Database Setup: If your project uses a database, make sure to set up the database and provide the connection details in your configuration.

Environment Variables: If your project relies on environment variables, ensure they are correctly set. You might use a tool like dotenv to manage environment variables.

API Keys and External Services: If your project uses external APIs or services, obtain the necessary API keys and credentials, and update your configuration.

These instructions are generic, so you might need to adjust them based on the specifics of your project. If your project has a README.md file, it's a good practice to check for setup instructions provided by the project authors.
