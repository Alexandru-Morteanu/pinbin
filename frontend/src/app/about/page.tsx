        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        Founded in 2023,{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-green-200">PinBin</span> started as a
        small group of environmental enthusiasts who were deeply concerned about
        the increasing pollution levels around the world. We realized that while
        many people were aware of the issue, there was a lack of a platform that
        could help individuals contribute towards the cause in a meaningful way.
        That's when PinBin was born.

        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        Our mission is to raise awareness about pollution and inspire action
        through the power of photography. We believe in the power of community
        and the impact that each individual can make. We aim to bring together
        people from all walks of life to contribute towards a cleaner and
        healthier planet.

        What We Do
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        At PinBin, we have created a unique platform where people can share
        photos of areas affected by high pollution. These images serve as a
        stark reminder of the environmental issues we face today. But more
        importantly, they help us raise funds to support cleanup and
        conservation efforts. Each photo uploaded on our platform is a step
        towards a cleaner, healthier planet.
      </p>

        Our Impact
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        Since our inception, we have seen a tremendous response from our
        community. Thousands of photos have been uploaded on our platform,
        helping us raise significant funds for various environmental causes. We
        have partnered with several non-profit organizations and have been able
        to contribute towards cleanup and conservation efforts in multiple
        regions.

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        At PinBin, we envision a future where every corner of our planet is free
        from pollution. Our goal is not just to raise awareness, but also to
        drive change. By bringing the reality of pollution to the forefront, we
        hope to inspire individuals, communities, and governments to take
        action. We dream of a world where our children can breathe clean air,
        drink pure water, and enjoy the beauty of nature in its most pristine
        form.
